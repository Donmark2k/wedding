              really a caring fellow, always ready to help out and had no time to waste. We had a brother and sister
              friendship, lol. If anyone told me this would be your husband, I would have just laughed at the person.

              were just elected as Excos and during our first meeting we were asked to introduce ourselves and she did.
              What got my attention was her surname ‚ÄúOkpara‚Äù. I was like I have seen my sister that my dad gave birth to
              without informing us.

              thought my guy was joking, but here we are‚ù§. Fidel has impacted my life greatly and consistently helps me to
